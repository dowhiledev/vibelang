# VibeLang VS Code Extension

This extension provides basic syntax highlighting for `.vibe` files.

## Usage

1. Open the `vscode` folder in VS Code.
2. Press `F5` to launch a new Extension Development Host.
3. Open a VibeLang file (`*.vibe`) to see highlighted syntax.

This extension is minimal and only includes highlighting rules. Additional
features like code completion and diagnostics may be added in the future.
